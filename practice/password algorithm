set correctPassword 
set Access to false
set Trials to 0
while Access is false
prompt user for String
assign user String to variable userPassword
if userPassword = correctPassword 
alert "Access granted!"
set Access to true
else increment Trials
if Trials = 3
alert "Access denied!"
set Access to true

"hello"
Access = false
Trials = 3
"bye"
"hey there"
"sorry"
alert "Access denied!"
end loop

his solution:

set correctPassword
set keepGoing to true
set Trials to 0
while keepGoing is true
increment Trials
prompt user for String
assign user String to variable userPassword
if userPassword = correctPassword
alert "Access granted!"
set keepGoing to false
else if Trials >= 3
alert "Access denied!"
set keepGoing to false

(if neither the password is correct nor the user has reached three trials, the loop restarts and the user is prompted for the password again)
